Password Strength Evaluation:
The password is assessed based on:

Length: Must be longer than 8 characters.
Uppercase and lowercase letters.
Presence of numbers.
Presence of special characters.
Recommendations:
If the password is weak, recommendations are provided to improve it, such as adding uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters.

Interactive Interface:
The password is entered through an interactive interface using ipywidgets in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Common Password Check:
If the password is among common passwords, the user is warned to avoid using it.

Main Objectives of the Project:
Evaluate password strength and show how strong it is.
Raise awareness of the importance of choosing strong passwords to ensure account security.
Improve passwords by providing recommendations to make them more secure.
This project serves as a useful tool for testing passwords and enhancing digital security for users.
